The development of the parachute in the 18th century followed the invention of the balloon. Some of the earliest tests of parachutes involved dogs, cats, and domesticated fowl. In a 19 September 1783 demonstration in Versailles observed by Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, a duck, a rooster, and a sheep were carried by a Montgolfier brother balloon for eight minutes.


In the early 1780s, Louis-SÃ©bastien Lenormand parachuted a cat and a dog from the top of Babotte Tower in Montpellier, France. In 1784, the Marquis de Brantes parachuted a sheep from the roof of the Palais des Papes in Avignon. Soon after, Joseph Montgolfier dropped animals from towers to test parachute-like devices.


During the balloon craze known as balloonomania in the late 18th and 19th centuries, balloonists, known then as aeronauts, began experimenting with parachuting animals.
